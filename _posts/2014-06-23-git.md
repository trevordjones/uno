Get started with Git!

Git is a version control system (VCS). Make sense? Didn't to me either. To help describe it, think of it as doing 'Save As' to your document multiple times. This way, you have a documented history of all the changes you've made. You've made 6 drafts, but you don't like drafts 4, 5, and 6. But you love 3, so you can just go back to 3 and try again. It helps you control your different versions. It's works a little differently than that 'Save As' example, but just think of it as Git tracking all of your changes(when you tell it to), which allows you to pick up at any point in your project. Again, this is fantastic if you find that a bug was introduced in version 6 and you need to go back to track it or start over in version 5.

Let's get started. We use Git in the terminal. If you came straight here without viewing my [terminal tutorial]({% post_url 2014-06-21-terminal %}) and don't know what I'm talking about, then go have a look. And if you haven't downloaded it yet, do that [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads).

With Git there are a few commands you should become familiar with if you're going to use it often. These commands will get you through most of what you will use Git for, unless you want to become much more advanced, but that's not what this tutorial is for, so for now, we'll start with these simple commands:

{% raw %}

*git init
*git add
*git commit
*git status   

{% endraw %}

Easy, right? Here are some explanations (again, things that I couldn't find clearly explained online. I'll also further explain everything with an example later on so if you don't get it on the first read, read through the examples):

`git init`: This is the command to set up Git for your project. Git does some of its stuff to your folder to prepare it to start tracking with the other Git commands. This is why it's imperative for you to be in the right folder, so be sure to navigate to that folder in your terminal or command prompt BEFORE you `git init`. So if your project is in the 'Sample-Project' folder which sits in your 'Users' folder, navigate by 'cd Users/Sample-Project' and then run `git init`. You only need to do this once with each project.

`git add`: This is where you add the file(s) that you want Git to save a version of. So if you have a Ruby project called 'example.rb' the command is `git add example.rb`. Now Git is aware of this file because you added it.

git commit: Now that you've added the files to be tracked it's time to save a version of them. Here is the command: `git commit 'file_name'.rb -m "First commit"`. Now to explain. `git commit` is just telling Git to commit the file. The '-m' is your way of telling Git you want to add a message, or a note explaining your commit. Later on I'll show you where this message shows up. The strings in the parenthesis are your actual message. Try to be descriptive with this so you know what version of your project you're committing.

`git status`: This does exactly what you think it does. At any point in your project, you can run `git status` to see which files have been added to Git, which files have changes and haven't been added, etc, etc. I encourage you throughout this tutorial to run `git status` now and then to see the different prompts it gives you regarding your files. Seeing examples will help you understand. (not yet though...wait until we `init` a folder.)

And those are your commands! You can review further commands if you wish at the [Git Reference](http://gitref.org/) site.

So let's do an example. Feel free to follow along to the T - it's often a good way to learn. Let's just use Git for a story - we are writing a novel and want to keep track of all our versions for it. We'll write 3 (extremely short) chapters to help you get the hang of this.

Create a folder for our novel. Feel free to create it on your desktop or Users folder, somewhere it's easily accessible. Now let's add 3 text files to it. Open up your text editor of choice and save three files to this folder. Call them chapter_1.txt, chapter_2.txt and chapter_3.txt (the txt is just indicating that it's a plain text file).

For the sake of time, don't worry about typing anything in, feel free to copy/paste the sentences below.

#### Chapter 1:
Once upon a time there was a young girl whose father passed away.
Her father had just married a woman with two daughters.
Her father had apparently made a bad choice in women.

#### Chapter 2
The poor young girl was forced to do chores all day long.
She mopped the floors, fed the animals, made the meals.
Her step-mother was relentless, cruel and evil.

#### Chapter 3
One day, the king announced a ball to be held for all the available women in the kingdom.
The step-mother and her daughters were excited to attend!
But they wouldn't allow poor Cinderella to go.

Bare bones I know, but who wants to spend time with the story? We're learning Git, not how to write the next great American novel. Now let's start using Git! Open up your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your Novel folder. Once you're there you can type `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac) and you should see your three chapters listed.

First, let's introduce ourselves to Git, so it knows who we are. First, type in this command: `$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"`
Hit 'Enter'

Then this command: `$ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com`

Be sure to change everything up to your specifications, then hit 'Enter'. Now Git knows who you are!

Make sure you're in the 'Novel' folder and type in `git init`. It should now say something like the following:

`Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/trevorjones/Desktop/Novel/.git/`

Now Git is aware of our project and is set up to start tracking it.

Remember how I said using `git status` throughout will be helpful for you to understand what's going on? Go ahead and type it in. You should see something to the effect of:

![Git status]({{ site:url }}/images/git-status-red.png)

So Git is being helpful. It's telling us we don't have any committed or added files yet, but it does see that we have three files. Now we have to add, then commit. My instructor told us to think of that process like shopping in a grocery store. Adding is like putting items in your cart. Committing is then actually purchasing the items. It's a 2 step process to get your folder on Git, beginning with `add`.

Remember it's `git add file_name`. One tip I suggest is using a `.` in place of `file_name`. This will automatically add all files in your folder so you don't have to add each individually. So let's do that.

`git add .`

Did anything happen? Good! Git doesn't tell you anything here, which means it worked. Now type in `git status` and you should see:

![Git status]({{ site:url }}/images/git-status-green.png)

So it worked! Your files have been added (just ignore the line under "Changes to be committed:"). Now they are ready to be committed. Type in: `git commit -m "First Commit"`

You'll get more more lines from Git, but now just type `git status` and you'll see:

![Git status and commit]({{ site:url }}/images/status-and-commit.png)

Which means your files have been committed! Great - now what? Where are the files? How do we access them? It doesn't do us much good if we can't get to them. Well, Git comes with a built-in GUI which stands for Graphical User Interface, so this will let you get the visual of your files and what is happening. So now just type in `gitk`, hit 'Enter' and this GUI will open and allow you to view your chapters.

![Running Git the first time]({{ site.url }}/images/gitk-first-time.png)

Take some time to look through this to understand it a bit better. The top left you'll see the master branch. Think of it as the trunk on a tree for your project. It's the main part and you can branch off of it if you want/need to - maybe you want to try something out on a project to see if it works but you don't want to affect the main project....something like that. You see your name and email (remember when we introduced ourselves to Git?)

Then below we see a few things. This isn't very intuitive so I'll go over quickly how to access your chapters. Feel free to reference the image above. The left hand side is basically telling you who's been working on Git for this file. The right is where we can find our commits. Right now, "Patch" is probably highlighted. Just hit "Tree". Then click on each chapter and on the left, you'll see what we typed in! And you'll see right above our text, we have "First commit", which was the message we typed after `-m` when we committed.

Ok - let's go back to our story. We need to update it a bit. We never introduced Cinderella, and the first chapter was kind of lame. Copy and paste the below into the appropriate chapters.

#### Chapter 1
Once upon a time there was a young girl named Cinderella whose father passed away.
He had chosen a bad time to do so, as he had just married a woman with two daughters.
Cinderella would learn just how bad her father was at choosing a good woman.

#### Chapter 2
Poor Cinderella was forced to do chores all day long.
She mopped the floors, fed the animals, made the meals.
Her step-mother was relentless, cruel and evil.

We'll leave Chapter 3 alone. Save your changes and go back to the terminal/command prompt. Wait! What's all this? It's `gitk` doing it's thing. Just hit Control C to get out. Now we can type in commands again. Let's start off by doing `git status`. Git has noticed our changes. Let's add the files we changed, so type `git add .` Then `git commit -m "Second commit`. Let's check it out with `gitk`.

![Git running the second time]({{ site:url }}/images/gitk-second-time.png)

You'll notice some changes now. When we have "Patch" highlighted we can see our files. Notice how the red text indicates what we had and the green indicates the changes we made. Now you can see what the first version of our story looked like!

I encourage you to do a few more commits and look at them by typing in `gitk`. It'll give you practice and then you can see all the changes you made as your versions develop. Hopefully you can see why this is so valuable in a programming project.

That's all for now! If you want to keep chugging forward, we can do [Github]({% post_url 2014-06-23-github %}) next! Ask any questions below if something didn't make sense or if you got stuck. I'm glad to help!
